### Code review
Prepare a piece of code which you think is representative/interesting or solves a difficult problem.
The rest of the group will give (constructive!) feedback on style/design (total +/- 30 minutes). The 
person that prepares a piece of code is also responsible for bringing the beamer and **cookies**.

### Progress/Tech
Either:
* Presentation about your current work, with focus on computational problems/difficulties. The aim
of this presentation is that others can help you with their expertise.
* Present about a useful package/module/feature/habit (e.g. git, anaconda, etc...)

Preferably does not take more than 30 minutes including questions.
